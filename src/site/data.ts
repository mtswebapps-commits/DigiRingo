/**
 * DIGIRINGO pricing — mirrors the app's canonical catalog (src/app/core/plans.ts).
 * Keep the two in sync: these are the numbers shown to customers, the app charges
 * from the same values.
 *
 * How it works:
 *   • Every number comes with a PLAN — pick Starter, Business or Pro (monthly or
 *     annual). Each plan includes ONE number plus a pool of minutes + SMS,
 *     and lets you add more numbers up to a cap.
 *   • When a plan's pool runs out you keep going pay-as-you-go (USAGE_RATES),
 *     funded from the wallet — and we alert you near the limit so you can upgrade.

  {
    q: "What exactly is DIGIRINGO?",
    a: "DIGIRINGO is an app that gives you real local phone numbers in multiple countries. You can call and text from them just like a normal SIM line — but everything lives in one simple app, with no physical SIM or contract.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a SIM card or a second phone?",
    a: "No. DIGIRINGO works entirely over the internet on the phone you already own. Add as many numbers as you like without swapping SIMs or carrying another device.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which countries are available?",
    a: "You can get local numbers in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, Germany, France, Brazil and more — with new countries added regularly. Some countries offer mobile numbers for full SMS support.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does billing work?",
    a: "Every number comes with a plan — you pick Starter, Business or Pro (billed monthly, or annually with 2 months free). Your plan includes one number plus a pool of minutes and SMS, and you can add more numbers up to the plan's limit ($2.99/mo local, $4.99/mo toll-free each). When your included minutes or SMS run out you simply keep going pay-as-you-go — voice from $0.015/min, SMS from $0.015/msg, drawn from your prepaid wallet. You can pay for a plan or an extra number straight from the wallet, or directly by card.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens when I hit my plan limit?",
    a: "We watch your usage and alert you inside the app (and web app) as you approach your plan's limit, so you can upgrade in a tap. If you keep going after the pool runs out, extra usage is billed pay-as-you-go from your wallet at standard rates — you're never cut off mid-conversation. Upgrading to a bigger plan gives you more included minutes, SMS and numbers.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I pay from my wallet or by card?",
    a: "Both. Every purchase — a plan, an extra number, or a wallet top-up — can be paid straight from your prepaid wallet balance, or directly by card. Pay-as-you-go usage beyond your plan is always drawn from the wallet, so keeping a little balance means you're never cut off mid-conversation.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I send business SMS?",
    a: "Yes. The built-in Trust Center walks you through registering your numbers (10DLC and carrier requirements) so your business messages are delivered reliably and stay compliant.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is it available on iPhone and Android?",
    a: "DIGIRINGO is built cross-platform and ships to both iOS and Android, with the same clean experience on every device.",
  },
