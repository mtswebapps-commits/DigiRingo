/**
 * DIGIRINGO plan catalog — the app's canonical pricing (mirrors server/plans.mjs
 * and the marketing site's src/site/data.ts). Prices are in USD.
 *
 * Two ways to pay for service:
 *   • A BUNDLE (Starter / Business / Pro) — a fixed monthly or annual fee that
 *     includes a number plus a pool of minutes + SMS.
 *   • PAY-AS-YOU-GO — no bundle: rent a number at the flat monthly rate and pay
 *     per use (USAGE_RATES), funded from the wallet.
 *
 * Either purchase can be paid two ways: from the prepaid wallet balance, or
 * directly by card (PayPal). The SERVER is the source of truth for the amount —
 * these values must match server/plans.mjs.
